# Car Insurance Claim Prediction

This project was developed as part of my Data Bootcamp course.  
It explores **predictive modeling for car insurance claims** using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and XGBoost.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle car insurance claims dataset
- Includes features like income, home value, years on job, vehicle age, and occupation

## Methods
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features)
- Multiple classification models tested:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost

## Results (Highlights)
- Evaluated models using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1**
- XGBoost achieved the strongest performance overall with balanced precision/recall

## How to Run
```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/aneekap/aneeka_data_bootcamp_final_project.git
cd aneeka_data_bootcamp_final_project

# run notebook
jupyter notebook Final_project_code.ipynb
